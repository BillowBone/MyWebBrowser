# MyWebBrowser
Web browser made with visual studio using c# and .NET

This web browser manages your favorites, a favorites bar, an history, new tabs (10 max) and settings (modify the name of the browser, its home URL and select if you want the history feature or not)

The web browser item used in Visual Studio depends on Internet Explorer and has the same behaviour

Warning : you can't build this project yourself if you don't have at least DevExpress 15.1, execute the setup.exe file in the Setup folder to install the web browser to your computer (Windows only)

I have only produced the code in the Source folder, Designer folder contains code generated by Visual Studio for the forms graphics design
